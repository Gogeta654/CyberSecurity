## Topics Covered

### 1. Foundations and Theory
- Introduction to cybersecurity principles
- Networking fundamentals (OSI, TCP/IP, ports, protocols)
- Linux essentials and shell scripting
- Operating system internals (Windows & Linux)
- Encryption, hashing, and cryptographic concepts
- Security models and best practices (CIA triad, least privilege)

---

### 2. Defensive Security (Blue Team)
- Threat detection and response
- Log analysis and SIEM (Splunk, ELK)
- Firewall and IDS/IPS configuration

### 3. Offensive Security (Ethical Hacking / Red Team)
> **All offensive techniques are demonstrated in controlled environments only.**
- Reconnaissance & OSINT
- Vulnerability scanning and enumeration
- Exploitation basics (using Metasploit, etc.)
- Web application security (OWASP Top 10)
- CTF-style practice labs
- Post-exploitation basics in isolated virtual labs

---

### 4. Cybersecurity Tools Uses
Learn how to use and configure the most essential tools in the field:
- **Nmap** – Network discovery and scanning
- **Wireshark** – Packet sniffing and traffic analysis
- **Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP** – Web application testing
- **Metasploit Framework** – Exploit development and testing (lab use only)
- **Hashcat / John the Ripper** – Password cracking in a legal setting
- **Splunk / ELK** – Log analysis and incident response

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> This course is for **educational purposes only**. All demonstrations, tools, and techniques are used strictly within **legal, isolated environments** (such as local VMs, test networks, or CTF labs).

Unauthorized access to systems you do not own is **illegal** and unethical.

The goal of this course is to **build better defenders, ethical hackers, and security-conscious developers** — not to promote or enable malicious behavior.
